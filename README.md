# About
This is a [Firebot](https://firebot.app) script to add integration with the [Natural Selection 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4920/Natural_Selection_2/) game created by [Unknown Worlds Entertainment](https://store.steampowered.com/developer/unknown-worlds). Natural Selection 2 is a multiplayer first-person shooter and real-time strategy game.

This project is a work-in-progress, and some features are subject to change. It is currently designed to work with Firebot v5.

## Design
This script monitors the NS2 log file (at `%APPDATA%\Natural Selection 2\log.txt`), adds some state tracking for it, and Bob's yer uncle.

## Installation
1. Download the latest `naturalSelectionTwoFirebot.js` file from [Releases](https://github.com/phroggster/firebot-natural-selection-two/releases).
2. Activate the Firebot window, and navigate to *Settings* (gear icon in bottom left), then the *Scripts* page.
3. **Enable** Custom Scripts *if* they are presently Disabled.
4. Click the *"Manage* *Startup* *Scripts*" button.
5. Click the *"Add* *New* *Script"* button, then click the <ins>scripts folder</ins> link in the top box.
6. Copy or move the `naturalSelectionTwoFirebot.js` file downloaded in step 1 into the folder that appeared, then close the folder.
7. Click the ðŸ”„ (sync icon) in the *"Add* *New* *Startup* *Script"* dialog, then select the `naturalSelectionTwoFirebot.js` file from the *"Pick* *one"* dropdown.
6. (*Optional*) Adjust the script settings *if* desired.
7. *Save* the script settings, dismiss the "*Startup* *Scripts*" dialog, and you should now have a variety of new events and variables related to Natural Selection 2 available in Firebot.

## Features
[Effects](https://github.com/phroggster/firebot-natural-selection-two/wiki/Effects) | [Events](https://github.com/phroggster/firebot-natural-selection-two/wiki/Events) | [Variables](https://github.com/phroggster/firebot-natural-selection-two/wiki/Variables)

## Building
Run `npm run build` to compile it into the dist subfolder.

Run `npm run build:dev` to compile and copy it into your Firebot profile's script folder. You will *likely* **need** to restart Firebot if it is already running.

## Testing
Not yet implemented, and horribly broken. Will someone help me here, wtf am I doing wrong? But `npm run test` once these bugs are sorted out.
